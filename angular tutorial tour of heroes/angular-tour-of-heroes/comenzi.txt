ng new angular-tour-of-heroes
cd angular-tour-of-heroes
ng serve --open 
the ng serve command builds the application, starts the development server, watches the

app.component.ts the component class code written in TypeScript
app.component.html the component template written in html
app.component.css the component's private css style
this tutorial does not cover testing

src/styles.css has application-wide styles

ng generate component heroes

app/heroes/heroes.component.ts
import {Component} from '@angular/core';


@Component({
  selector: 'app-heroes',
  templateUrl: './heroes.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./heroes.component.css']
})
export class HeroesComponent {
  
}

you can always import the component symbol from the angular core lib and annotate the component 
class with @Componentng ggenerate created three metadata properties:
selector: the component's css element selector
templateUrl: the location of the component's template file
styleUrls: the location of the component's private css styles
the css element selector, 'app-heroes' matches the name of the html element that identifies this
component within a parent component's template
always export the component class so you can import it elsewhere, like in the AppModule

add a hero property in heroes.component.ts
hero = 'Windstorm';
